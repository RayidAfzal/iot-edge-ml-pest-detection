# iot-edge-ml-pest-detection
A distributed IoT system that performs real-time pest detection using edge-deployed machine learning. Environmental data from multiple sensor nodes is processed at a local gateway, where a Random Forest model predicts pest conditions with low latency. Results are stored in MongoDB and visualized via a custom web dashboard.
